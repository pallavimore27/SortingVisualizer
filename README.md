📊 Sorting Visualizer
🔍 Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a web application built using React.js and Redux that visually shows how different sorting algorithms work. It helps users understand sorting step by step using animated bars.

✨ Features

🎲 Generate random array

📊 Visualize sorting with animations

🔁 Algorithms supported:
Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

⏱️ Control sorting speed

📘 Display time complexity

🛠️ Technologies Used
⚛️ React.js

🧠 Redux

💻 JavaScript

🎨 HTML & CSS

🔄 Project Flow

The application generates a random array and displays it as vertical bars. When the user selects an algorithm and speed, Redux updates the state. The selected sorting algorithm runs step by step, and the bars change color and position until the array is sorted.

⚙️ How to Run the Project Locally
