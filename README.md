📊 Sorting Visualizer
🔍 Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a web application built using React.js and Redux that visually shows how different sorting algorithms work. It helps users understand sorting step by step using animated bars.

✨ Features

🎲 Generate random array
📊 Visualize sorting with animations

🔁 Algorithms supported:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

⏱️ Control sorting speed
📘 Display time complexity

🛠️ Technologies Used
⚛️ React.js
🧠 Redux
💻 JavaScript
🎨 HTML & CSS

🔄 Project Flow
The application generates a random array and displays it as vertical bars. When the user selects an algorithm and speed, Redux updates the state. The selected sorting algorithm runs step by step, and the bars change color and position until the array is sorted.

⚙️ How to Run the Project Locally
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/pallavimore27/SortingVisualizer.git

2️⃣ Go to Project Folder
cd SortingVisualizer

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install

4️⃣ Start the Application
npm start

5️⃣ Open in Browser
http://localhost:3000

Learning Outcome

This project improved my understanding of sorting algorithms, React, and Redux, and helped me connect theory with practical implementation.
